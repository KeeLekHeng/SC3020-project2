"""
Read query plans and prepare them for comparison.

The project compares PostgreSQL's plan for a query with a plan proposed by an AI agent.
This module defines PlanNode, the single representation both plans are converted into,
and two functions:

- get_postgres_plan() runs EXPLAIN and returns PostgreSQL's plan as a PlanNode tree,
  optionally with measured times (ANALYZE), hints, or both.
- build_hints() turns a PlanNode tree into pg_hint_plan hints that ask PostgreSQL to use
  that plan. comparison.force_plan() plans the query with them, which this project
  calls forcing the plan.

A plan from another source, such as the AI agent, is built into PlanNode from field
names, so comparison.py works on one form for every source.

    Return pg_hint_plan hints that ask PostgreSQL to use this plan.

    The hints fix:

    - the method and index of every Seq Scan, Index Scan, Index Only Scan and Bitmap
      Heap Scan
    - the method of every Hash Join, Merge Join and Nested Loop
    - the join order and outer and inner sides, with one Leading hint per query level;
      a level's joins stop at named relations and at any operator that is not a join or
      a pass-through operator, and what lies below gets its own Leading hint
    - which scans run in parallel, and with how many workers; a plan without a Gather
      also gets Set(max_parallel_workers_per_gather 0), which turns parallelism off for
      the whole query
    - unless switch_offs=False, every operator in SWITCH_OFFS that the plan never uses
      is switched off for the whole query, such as hashed aggregation in a plan with
      only sorted aggregates

    Hints are requests, not commands: PostgreSQL silently skips any it cannot satisfy,
    so force with comparison.force_plan(), which checks the result.

    Limitations:

    - Not hinted per node, so left to the planner: other scan types (CTE, Function,
      Subquery, Values), aggregate, sort, set operation, Materialize and Memoize
      choices, and where a Gather is placed, such as a two-stage parallel aggregate. A
      switch-off only removes an operator the plan never uses, so a plan with one hashed
      and one sorted aggregate cannot fix which is which.
    - A switched-off operator the plan needs but does not show, such as a Materialize
      under a Nested Loop whose inner side is a join, adds PostgreSQL's cost for a
      disabled operator, 1e10, to every candidate plan. The planner then cannot compare
      their real costs and may break other hints; comparison.force_plan() catches this.
    - Hints name tables by alias. A node without an alias gets no scan hint, and a join
      over an unnamed operator, such as an Aggregate from a subquery or an Append over
      partitions, gets no join or Leading hint; only the switch-offs limit its method.
    - A name used twice, such as an unaliased lineitem in both the query and a subquery,
      appears in EXPLAIN as lineitem and lineitem_1. pg_hint_plan ignores the generated
      name and applies the lineitem hint to every use, so when a hint would need the
      generated name, build_hints raises ValueError. Distinct aliases in the query
      avoid this.
    - A parallel scan with no Gather above it gets no Parallel hint, because its worker
      count is unknown.
    - PostgreSQL cannot follow a plan it has no path for, for example an index or bitmap
      scan without a usable condition, a nested loop for a FULL JOIN, some outer and
      anti join side swaps, or a parallel scan inside a nested loop.

    Raises ValueError when the plan cannot be forced: a name used twice, as above, or a
    name that cannot be written safely in a hint comment.
